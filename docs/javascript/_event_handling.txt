01. What is the difference between onclick and addEventListener() in JavaScript?

🟣 onclick 
    ▫️ allows only one event handler for the same event.
    ▫️ Assigning a new handler replaces the previous one.
    ▫️ Only the last handler will run.

🟣 addEventListener()   
    ▫️ allows adding multiple handlers to the same event without removing old ones.
    ▫️ Each added handler is executed independently.

-----------------------------------------

02. Why does React use onClick instead of addEventListener()?

🟣 React does not attach events directly to DOM elements.
🟣 React provides its own synthetic event system for consistent behavior across browsers.
    ▫️ Registers the event efficiently behind the scenes
    ▫️ Normalizes event behavior across browsers
    ▫️ Manages memory and cleanup automatically
    ▫️ Delivers the final event to your component in a clean way
