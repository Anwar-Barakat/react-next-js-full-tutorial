# Assignment: Prisma Basics

This assignment focuses on integrating Prisma into a React application to perform basic CRUD operations.

## Task

1.  Set up a Prisma schema with a `User` model (already done).
2.  Implement a React component (`UserCrud`) that interacts with the database via Prisma Client.
3.  The component should be able to:
    *   Display a list of existing users.
    *   Add a new user (email and optional name).
4.  Write basic tests for the `UserCrud` component, mocking the Prisma Client.
