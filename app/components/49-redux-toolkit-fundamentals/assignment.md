# Redux Toolkit Fundamentals

This assignment focuses on understanding and implementing the core concepts of Redux Toolkit.

## Objectives:

1.  **Set up a Redux Store:** Learn how to configure a Redux store using `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
2.  **Create a Slice:** Understand how to define a Redux slice using `createSlice`, including initial state, reducers, and automatically generated action creators.
3.  **Integrate with React:** Connect the Redux store to a React application using `Provider` from `react-redux`.
4.  **Dispatch Actions:** Learn how to dispatch actions from React components using the `useDispatch` hook.
5.  **Select State:** Understand how to read data from the Redux store in React components using the `useSelector` hook.

## Task:

Implement a simple counter application using Redux Toolkit. The application should have:

-   A display for the current counter value.
-   A button to increment the counter.
-   A button to decrement the counter.
-   A button to increment the counter by a specific amount (e.g., 5).

Ensure proper TypeScript typing for the state, actions, and selectors.
