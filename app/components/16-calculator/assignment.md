# 16 - React Calculator

In this assignment, you will build a simple calculator using React.

## Requirements:
- Create a `Calculator` component.
- The calculator should have a display to show the current input and result.
- It should have buttons for numbers (0-9), basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=).
- The component should handle user input and perform calculations.
- Use the `useState` hook to manage the calculator's state (e.g., current input, previous input, operator).
- Style the calculator to be user-friendly.
