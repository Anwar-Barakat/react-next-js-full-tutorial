# Assignment: JSX Rules Exercise

## Step 1: Create a New Component

Create a new file called `JSXRules.tsx`.
Inside this file, write a functional component called `JSXRules`.
The component should return a `<div>` containing the following:
- A `<h1>` element with the text "JSX Rules".
- A paragraph (`<p>`) that lists at least 3 rules of JSX:
    - JSX must return a single parent element.
    - JSX elements must be properly closed.
    - JSX attributes are written using camelCase (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).

## Step 2: Render the Component

Import the `JSXRules` component into `app/page.tsx` and render it.
