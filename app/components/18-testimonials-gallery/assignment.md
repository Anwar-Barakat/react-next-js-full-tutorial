# 18 - Testimonials and Gallery

In this assignment, you will build two separate components: one for displaying testimonials and another for an image gallery.

## Requirements:

### Testimonials Component

- It should display a list of testimonials.
- Use a hardcoded array of testimonial objects (e.g., with properties like `id`, `author`, `text`, and `avatar`).

### Gallery Component
- Create a `Gallery` component.
- It should display a grid of images.
