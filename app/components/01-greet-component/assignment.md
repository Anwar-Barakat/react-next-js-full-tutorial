# Assignment: Create and Render a Greet Component

Your task is to create a simple "Greet" component and display it on the homepage with some basic styling.

1.  **Create the component:**
    -   Inside `app/components/01-greet-component`, create a file named `Greet.tsx`.
    -   In this file, define a functional component named `Greet` that returns an `<h1>` element with the text "Hello, World!".

2.  **Display the component:**
    -   Open `app/page.tsx`.
    -   Import the `Greet` component.
    -   Render the `Greet` component within the `Home` component's returned JSX.
